spark.sql.functions.explode
explode function creates a new row for each element in the given array or map column (in a DataFrame).

val signals: DataFrame = spark.read.json(signalsJson)
signals.withColumn("element", explode($"data.datapayload"))
explode creates a Column.

-------------------------------------------------
Dataset<Row> explode / flatMap operator (method)
explode operator is almost the explode function.

From the scaladoc:
explode returns a new Dataset where a single column has been expanded to zero or more rows by the provided function. 
This is similar to a LATERAL VIEW in HiveQL. All columns of the input row are implicitly joined with each value that is output by the function.

ds.flatMap(_.words.split(" "))
Please note that (again quoting the scaladoc):

Deprecated (Since version 2.0.0) use flatMap() or select() with functions.explode() instead
